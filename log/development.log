The board picked the bid from the experienced team of Skanska, Traylor and Sheaâ€”the most expensive by about $193 millionâ€”because staff think it provides the \"best opportunity to deliver the project on time and on budget,\" reports The Source. Preliminary work like utility relocation and exploratory digging (which has yielded some awesome fossils) has been going on for a while now, but the contract means earnest work can finally begin (this project has only been in the works for slightly less than a century); new stations will be built at Wilshire/La Brea, Wilshire/Fairfax, and Wilshire/La Cienega on the very edge of Beverly Hills.  The most current timeline is below and the line is set to open in 2023, assuming both Los Angeles and Beverly Hills allow Metro to work extended hours, which isn't necessarily a sure thing. Miracle Mile residents have been a little fussy and Beverly Hills has been doing everything in its power to stop this project, although they did finally give Metro construction permits.", "user_id"=>"1"}, "commit"=>"Create Micropost"}
